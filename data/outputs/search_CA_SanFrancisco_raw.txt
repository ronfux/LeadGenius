I will search for EMS businesses in San Francisco, CA, using the provided search terms and then format the findings into the requested JSON structure.
I will now gather the contact details for the companies already found and search for additional EMS providers in San Francisco to meet the target quantity.
I will now search for more local ambulance services and medical transport companies in San Francisco to broaden the list, specifically looking for companies like ProTransport-1, Norcal Ambulance, and Falcon Critical Care Transport.
I have identified nine EMS companies serving San Francisco and will now search for a few more, such as Pacific Medical Transport and California Medical Transport, to reach a total of twelve as planned.
I have a solid list of twelve EMS and medical transport companies and will now perform one final search for specific San Francisco addresses for Bay City Medical Transport and Eden Medical Transportation to complete the data set.
I will now verify the phone number for City Medical Transportation LLC in San Francisco to ensure the accuracy of the contact information for my final list.
