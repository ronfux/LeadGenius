I will search for EMS companies in Fresno, CA, including ambulance services and medical transport providers, and then compile the requested business information into the specified JSON format.

I will now perform targeted searches for each identified company to gather their specific contact details, including addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, to ensure a comprehensive and accurate data set.

I will search for additional EMS providers in Fresno, such as Pistoresi Ambulance, SEMSA, and Hall Ambulance, and look for a comprehensive list of Fresno County EMS providers to ensure I have a robust selection of 5-15 companies.

I have identified 10-12 EMS providers serving the Fresno area and will now perform one final search to find specific addresses and phone numbers for Vital Medical Transport, Hope Medical Transport LLC, Health Kulture Medical Transportation, and OnPoint Management Care before compiling the results into the final JSON.
