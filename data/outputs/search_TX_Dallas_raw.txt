I will search for EMS businesses in Dallas, TX, using the specified search terms to collect information for the requested data fields.
I will now search for the specific contact details, including addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, for the EMS and medical transportation companies identified in Dallas.
I will now search for the contact information for the remaining companies to ensure I have a comprehensive list of 5-15 businesses, as required.
I will now refine my search to find additional EMS companies with physical addresses within the Dallas city limits and attempt to locate missing phone numbers for UltraCare and MetaCare.
I have successfully identified 10 EMS and medical transportation companies serving the Dallas area, including their addresses, phone numbers, websites, and email addresses where available. I will now compile this information into the required JSON format.
